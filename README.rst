Introduction
============

Foobar is a template for a typical Python library package. It's licenced as
WTFPL, but you probably want to change that (LGPL works well for libraries).
You'll also want to find/replace all instances of "Foobar" and "foobar" with
your project name and package name, respectively (they might be the same).


Getting Started
===============

Requirements
------------

* Python 3
* ``setuptools`` and/or ``pip``


Installation
------------

Foobar can be installed with ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::

    pip install Foobar

Or directly from the source code::

    python setup.py install



Basic Usage
===========

After installation, abstract base classes can be imported from the package::

    python
    >>> import foobar
    foobar.__version__

Foobar doesn't do anything, it's a template.
